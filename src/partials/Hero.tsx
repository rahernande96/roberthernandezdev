        <>
          As a software developer with over 5 years of experience, my main focus
          has been on the backend, although I also have frontend skills. I am
          passionate about music and technology, and have worked on projects
          related to both areas. In addition, I have experience in cloud
          infrastructure and electronics projects.
          <br />
          My experience includes designing, developing and maintaining complex
          applications and systems in languages such as JavaScript, PHP and
          Python. I have worked on projects that require a solid understanding
          of databases such as SQL and NoSQL, and have implemented scalability
          and high availability solutions using technologies such as Docker and
          Kubernetes.
          <br />
          If you are looking for a software developer with backend experience
          and frontend skills, as well as experience in cloud and electronic
          infrastructure projects, I am available to consider exciting
          opportunities.
